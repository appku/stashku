## Planned Features
- [ ] Provide better documentation of features and usage by publishing jsdoc.
- [ ] Support in-browser use of StashKu.
- [ ] 100% line unit-test coverage on all files.
  - [x] Modeling
  - [x] Requests
  - [ ] Utilities
  - [ ] Base Classes

\* CLI and migration features have been moved to [StashKu Migrate](https://github.com/appku/stashku-migrate).

# Running
This is the core StashKu package and doesn not provide a CLI interface, as it is meant to be leveraged as a package. See the 
[StashKu Migrate](https://github.com/appku/stashku-migrate) for the `stashku` CLI tool.

# Configuration
StashKu can be configured using environmental variables.

| Property | ENV | Type | Default | Description |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| engine | STASHKU_ENGINE | `String` | `"memory"` | Specifies the name of the StashKu engine (or package) to initialize. The built-in options are: `"memory"`.

### Memory Storage Engine Configuration
| Property | ENV | Type | Default | Description |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| limit | STASHKU_MEMORY_LIMIT | `Number` | `0` | Specifies the maximum number of records allowed to be stored in the memory engine. Attempts to write more than this number will throw an exception. Set to a value of `0` or less to not enforce a limit. |

# Code Documentation
